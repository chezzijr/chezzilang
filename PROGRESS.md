## Current focus

**🟦 M19 — Perf track (in progress).** The language is frozen feature-wise; this milestone is pure
optimization, so the bar is **behavior-preserving + two-engine parity** on every change. Measure first
(`cargo run --release -- run benches/run.chz`), land behind a failing-then-green correctness test, keep
parity green, re-measure, record the delta in [`docs/benchmarks.md`](docs/benchmarks.md). Several levers
moved a *different* bench than predicted — trust the measurement, not the a-priori guess. The frozen
interp is untouched by VM-only work, so parity is automatic for those changes.

**Landed phases** (all TDD'd, two-engine-parity-clean; numbers + per-lever notes in
[`docs/benchmarks.md`](docs/benchmarks.md), ranked backlog in [`docs/future.md §4`](docs/future.md)):

- **Phase 1** — killed the per-call `Obj` clone in `invoke_value`; jump-relocating peephole + constant
  fold (`src/compiler/peephole.rs`, replicating the VM's checked overflow/div-by-zero semantics);
  superinstructions (`Op::BinLocalLocal`/`BinLocalConst`/`IncLocal`) fusing the hot local/const arith
  windows with an exact unfused fallback.
- **Phase 2** — in-place call args (`do_call` runs over the args already on the stack, killing the
  per-call `split_off` `Vec`); `stringify`-into-buffer (`BuildStr` reuses one buffer across interpolation
  parts).
- **Phase 2b** — global-slotting: every module global gets a stable `u32` slot; `GetGlobalSlot`/
  `SetGlobalSlot`/`DefineGlobalSlot` index `Obj::Module.slots` with no hash. Slot map lives in the shared
  `Arc<Program>` so parent and faulted-worker agree by construction (removes a latent snapshot
  ordering fragility).
- **Phase 3** — `ConstStr` interning (per-heap cache keyed by the literal's data pointer, GC-rooted,
  swapped with the heap across `swap_ctx`); per-char single-alloc `alloc_char` at every 1-char-string
  site.
- **Phase 4** — struct-field inline cache: `GetField`/`SetField` carry a per-call-site IC id into a
  per-`Vm` `field_ic` caching the field index. Runtime IC (the compiler is type-erased); holds an index
  not a `GcRef`, so it's invisible to GC/snapshots/`swap_ctx` and every access self-verifies.
- **Phase 5a** — FxHash (`src/vm/fxhash.rs`, no new dep) for `MapData`/`SetData` index + `str_intern`.
  `values_equal` confirms every hit ⇒ behavior-preserving. (Footgun caught by measuring: a naive
  multiply-only FxHash was 100× slower on int keys — fixed with a splitmix64 finalizer.)
- **Phase 5b** — struct type-id guard (`Obj::Struct.tid`, dense layout id): the field-IC hit guards on
  `cell.tid == obj.tid` instead of a string re-verify. Measured **neutral**, kept as the principled
  guard. The field-IC lever is now spent.
- **Call-loop flattening** — the bytecode `Op::Call` fast path now pushes the callee frame and lets the
  running `run_until` loop execute it (CPython-3.11 "zero-cost frames"), removing the per-call Rust
  `run_until` recursion **and** the per-call `Arc::clone(&self.program)`. HOFs / struct methods keep the
  re-entrant `run_proto` (they need the callee result synchronously mid-Rust-method). **Robustness bonus:**
  deep *plain* recursion no longer consumes host stack — bounded by `MAX_CALL_DEPTH`, not the thread
  stack. (Follow-up: flatten `do_method_call` for the `struct`/method benches.)
- **Small-string optimization (SSO)** — `Obj::Str` holds a `ChzStr` (`src/vm/chzstr.rs`): ≤22 UTF-8
  bytes live inline in the variant, longer spill to `Box<str>`. `Deref<str>` + `From` impls kept the
  ~100 match arms unchanged; `Clone`/`Eq`/`Hash` delegate to `as_str()` so map keys / interning / `==`
  stay byte-identical. `size_of::<Obj>()` unchanged at 88 B (guard-tested). Closes the SSO lever.
- **Phase 6 — method-call IC + flatten `do_method_call`** — `Op::CallMethod` carries a per-site `ic`;
  a struct receiver caches `(tid → proto, module_idx)` in a per-`Vm` `method_ic` vec (a hit skips the
  `program.structs` clone + the name-keyed `def.methods` probe), AND flattens the call (frame pushed in
  place; the running `run_until` executes it, no re-entrant `run_proto`). No `GcRef` in the cell ⇒
  swap/GC-invisible like the field IC; `NO_IC` re-entry callers (`spawn`/`defer` method) keep `run_proto`.
  **`struct` 2.90×→2.63× (−9%)**, the predicted bench; only it moved (it's the OO-dispatch bench).
- **Phase 7 — inline hot ops in `run_until`** — the dispatch loop handles the hottest opcodes inline
  (`GetLocal`/`SetLocal`, the superinstrs, `Jump`/`JumpIfFalse`, `Call`/`Return`) and delegates the tail
  to `step`, skipping a fn-call + the big match jump-table per op. Inlined arms reuse `step`'s helpers /
  copy its 1–3-line bodies (one source of truth). **Biggest lever of the session — moved every op-bound
  bench: `loop` 1.30×→~1.10× (−15%, was the dispatch floor), `list` 3.06×→~2.55× (−17%), `primes` −8%,
  `fib` −6%, `struct`/`str`/`map` −4–5%.**
- **Phase 8 — call-site spec for `Op::Call` — analyzed, DEFERRED (no-gain).** After Phase 7 inline,
  `do_call`'s happy path is already lean (the deref a call-IC skips is ~2–3 instrs); fib's residual is
  frame-setup in `finish_frame`, which a dispatch cache doesn't touch. A correct call-IC also can't avoid
  a heap-specific callee handle ⇒ `swap_ctx` hazard for ~0 gain. fib's real lever is Tier 2 (PEP 659) /
  Tier 3 (JIT). Full rationale in [`docs/benchmarks.md`](docs/benchmarks.md).

**Remaining / blocked levers:**

- **NaN-boxing `Value` is BLOCKED by full 64-bit ints, not "next."** `Value::Int` is a full `i64`; an
  i64 + a type tag don't fit in 8 bytes alongside `f64`, so it needs boxed big ints (branch + alloc per
  int, semantics-sensitive overflow) — not behavior-preserving, uncertain win on the very int benches it
  targets (Lua 5.4 stayed 16-byte for this exact reason). Blast radius is VM-only (the frozen interp has
  its own `Rc`-based `Value`), but it's a milestone spike. Parked.
- **String concat/split builder/rope** moves no current bench — `join` already buffers into one `String`;
  `+`/`split` aren't exercised by the `str` bench.
- **Arith specialization + frame pooling: effectively closed** — superinstructions inline the monomorphic
  int path; `CallFrame`'s `Vec`s are alloc-free (no per-call frame alloc to pool).
- **Big/separate milestones** (only once the language has truly stopped moving): NaN-boxing as its own
  milestone, register VM, generational/incremental GC, and **Cranelift AOT/JIT as the stretch end-game**.

Gap to CPython after Phases 6–7 **~1.1×–3.2×** slower (worst still call-bound `fib` ~3.2×, then `map`/
`struct`/`list`/`primes` ~2.3–2.7×, `str` ~2.0×; **`loop` ~1.1×** — near parity, was the dispatch
floor), startup ~11× **faster**. **1607 tests** green, conformance 7/7, `clippy --all-targets` clean.

**Tier-2 index specialization landed (2026-06-12):** Int-key fast path in `get_index`/`set_index`
(skips `hash_key_rooted`'s rooting — alloc-free for an int key) + inline `GetIndex`/`SetIndex` in the
`run_until` hot arm. **`list` −4%** (its `for x in xs` lowers to per-element `GetIndex`); **`map`
neutral** (FxHashMap-probe-bound, not rooting/dispatch-bound — the predicted target didn't move, the
recurring "measure, don't guess" lesson). Behavior-preserving (7 `idxspec_*` VM==interp guards, incl.
the Int/Float key-collision trap). Moving `map` needs a denser int-keyed map, not this in-place tweak.
See `docs/benchmarks.md` "M19 Tier-2".

**▶ Next perf batch (Tier 1 DONE — Phases 6+7 landed, 8 deferred; Tier 2 is next; full detail +
`file:line`s in [`docs/future.md §4` "Post-M19 next levers"](docs/future.md)).** Diagnosis: the
remaining gap is **call frame-setup + the alloc/hash paths**, not per-op dispatch (Phase 7 took `loop`
to ~1.1×). Target is CPython 3.14 (specializing interpreter + optional JIT).
- **Tier 1 (cheap→medium):** ✅ 1. method-call IC + flatten `do_method_call` (Phase 6, `struct` −9%).
  ✅ 2. trim per-op overhead in `run_until` — landed as **inline hot ops** (Phase 7; every op-bound bench
  faster, `loop`/`list` −15/−17%). The other two sub-levers (lazy `span`, serial/MN loop split) were left
  unshipped — predictably-false cheap branches, low expected payoff vs the inline win; revisit only if a
  profile shows them. ⏸️ 3. call-site specialization for `Op::Call` — **deferred (no-gain after inline);**
  see the Phase 8 bullet above + `docs/benchmarks.md`.
- **Tier 2 (structural) — START HERE NEXT:** 4. **adaptive opcode quickening (PEP 659)** — rewrite ops to
  type-specialized forms at runtime behind a deopt guard (generalizes superinstructions + ICs; cells in a
  per-`Vm` side table, not the shared `Arc<Program>`); the single most CPython-3.14-like lever, and the
  unifying mechanism for the method/field/call caches. ✅ 5. **map/list index specialization** (`mod.rs`
  `GetIndex`/`SetIndex`) — **landed (Int-key fast path + inline dispatch): `list` −4%, `map` neutral**
  (hash-probe-bound). The remaining `map` win needs a denser int-keyed representation, not this in-place
  tweak — folds into #4 or its own lever.
- **Tier 3 (big, separate):** 6. **Cranelift method-JIT** (end-game; the only path to match/beat fib;
  #4 is the stepping stone). 7. NaN-boxing (BLOCKED, above). 8. register VM / generational GC (low ROI).

### Robustness pass (landed, both engines)
- **Cyclic-data depth guard + order-independent map `==`.** Two fuzzing-found bugs: a cyclic struct made
  `print`/`==` recurse unbounded on the host stack (uncatchable SIGABRT, even inside `recover:`); and map
  `==` was order-dependent while set `==` was order-independent. Fix: `MAX_STRUCTURAL_DEPTH = 10_000`
  threaded through display + a `values_equal_guarded` (the public `values_equal -> bool` stays a thin
  wrapper, so the ~66 hash-probe call sites are untouched); the recoverable depth-exceeded error surfaces
  only at the `==`/`!=` op sites. Map `==` is now order-independent value equality. (Interp's *call*-depth
  overflow in **debug** builds is left as-is — the tree-walk engine is slated for removal; release + VM
  are fine.)
- **`defer:` block form** — `defer` takes an indented block as well as a single call (multi-action cleanup
  without N `defer` lines), mirroring `spawn`'s dual form with no new VM op. Body runs top-to-bottom at
  scope exit, LIFO as a unit, free vars snapshot by value at the `defer` point, runs on all exit paths.
  A dedicated `defer_floors` write-gate rejects reassigning an enclosing local inside the block (no
  `SetCaptured` op); a `?` short-circuit inside the block is absorbed on both engines.

## Concurrency — feature-complete (confirmed 2026-06-12)

Core feature-complete through **M18**; **concurrency shipped through Tier-D (D0–D6c) + M-C**. The surface —
`spawn` / `parallel:` nursery / `Channel[T]` / `Shared[T]` / `Executor`, plus `--parallel` (the VM's real
OS-thread engine) and the netpoller + `std.net` — is complete and stable. **M-C implicit nurseries shipped
(2026-06-12)** — every function body and the module top level is an implicit nursery; a bare `spawn` is
legal anywhere and joins at `return`/end. ~1592 tests green; the default cooperative engine and `--parallel`
stay byte-identical on every `examples/parallel*.chz` + `examples/implicit_nursery.chz` golden, and the
frozen interp is the differential parity oracle for the sequential subset.

> **`Channel.recv_timeout(ms)` — attempted then reverted (2026-06-12).** A bounded-wait `recv` was
> implemented with a **demote-always** shortcut (reuse `demote_recv_block` + a deadline) to avoid the
> heavier park+timer machinery. The review panel found it **unsound at `native_reentry == 0`**: (1) a
> top-level M:N `recv_timeout` demotes the worker, and a later reduction-budget yield strands the fiber →
> **silent hang**; (2) the cooperative park path reused `park_recv` (built for 0-arg `recv`) but
> `recv_timeout` has `argc=1` → **stack corruption** on resume; (3) cooperative-nursery no-producer faults
> `deadlock` not `None`, and demote-failure faults (not total). Reverted (commit `653dfd2`). **Lesson: the
> correct design is the heavier one** — at `native_reentry == 0`, snapshot-park on a timer (claim-flag +
> a `MnSched::timeout_wake` racing `send_wake`, like the socket-timeout `poll_timed_out` path), demote
> only at `native_reentry > 0`; cooperative needs a recv_timeout-aware quiesce (resolve-to-`None`, not
> fault) or accept the documented deadlock-fault divergence. Checker `Ty::Int → Option[elem]` sig + interp
> poll-once arm were correct; the VM scheduler integration is the hard part. A proper follow-up, not a
> drop-in. (`select` / `Atomic[int]` remain deferred too — both need a design brainstorm.)

> **Concurrency follow-ups — `Atomic[T]` + `timer(ms)` LANDED, `recv_timeout` DROPPED, `wait` designed
> (2026-06-13).** Brainstormed the deferred trio and shipped two of three; `recv_timeout` is dropped as
> redundant.
> - **`Atomic[T]`** (commit `07ae080`) — generic atomic box mirroring `Shared[T]` (Mutex-backed, sendable
>   handle, value-first `Atomic(v)`): `load`/`store`/`exchange`/`cas` for any `T`, `add`/`sub` on numeric
>   `T` (checked-overflow like `+`/`-`). Two-engine parity; `--parallel` add/cas atomicity stress tests
>   (300-thread exact sum, 200-fiber CAS-retry). See `docs/concurrency.md §6b`.
> - **`timer(ms) -> Channel[bool]`** (commit `cd1673e`) — one-shot, **level-triggered** timeout channel.
>   Delivery is scheduled **at `recv` time in the receiver's own scheduler** (NOT at construction — a
>   top-level timer can be recv'd in a `--parallel` child): `--parallel` schedules a background `send` +
>   parks (accounted `inflight` so no false deadlock); cooperative VM / interp / callbacks inline-sleep to
>   the deadline (like their `sleep_ms`). 3-engine parity. Adversarial review (Reality Checker + Code
>   Reviewer) found **no Critical/Important** — sound park-gap (reuses `MnSched::park`'s queue re-check),
>   no inflight leak (job holds Arcs + always `fetch_sub`s), no double-schedule (queue-first on re-run).
>   Known v1 limitation: `timer.recv()` inside a native callback pins a worker (no demote). `docs §6c`.
> - **`recv_timeout` DROPPED** — `wait` + `timer` subsume it (`ch.recv_timeout(500)` ≡ `wait` over `ch`
>   and `timer(500)`), and it was the unsound/reverted one. No separate primitive.
> - **`wait` (select) — DESIGNED, NOT IMPLEMENTED. Start the next concurrency session here.** Full locked
>   design + grammar + per-engine semantics + the multi-channel-park implementation notes are in
>   **`docs/concurrency.md §6d`** (and the `wait`/`timer`/`Atomic` cheat rows in `docs/syntax.md §11b`).
>   Summary: a `wait:` compound statement racing channel `recv`s — arms `v := ch.recv():` (`:=`/`=`/`_`
>   targets), optional non-blocking `else:`, recv-only (unbounded channels → sends never block). Keyword
>   chosen to **not** look Go-like; `else` reuses the existing keyword; closed+empty arm is **skipped**
>   (option B), all-closed+no-else faults. The hard part (its own milestone, the area `recv_timeout` was
>   reverted in): the **blocking multi-channel park** — one fiber parked on N channels, first sender wins +
>   sweeps it from the other buckets via a claim-flag, in BOTH the M:N and cooperative schedulers, with the
>   single-channel `recv` as the 1-key special case. Non-blocking (`else`) + the poll step reuse `try_recv`
>   (timer arms are already deadline-aware).

### Tier-D — complete (D0–D6c)

Designed in [`docs/concurrency.md §10`](docs/concurrency.md); the full per-phase TDD breakdown lives in
**[`docs/concurrency-tier-d.md`](docs/concurrency-tier-d.md)**. Landed, in one summary:

- **D0** — O(N²)→O(N·logN) cooperative ready-queue (per-nursery `ready` set + parked-index buckets).
- **D1** — lazy module snapshot: a shared read-only `Arc<ModuleSnapshot>` faulted into each worker heap
  on first access, killing the per-task module-graph rebuild.
- **D2a/D2b** — true **M:N work-stealing scheduler**: lightweight share-nothing fibers (own heap, carried
  in a swappable `FiberCtx`) multiplexed over the bounded pool, **parking on `recv` instead of pinning OS
  threads**; the joining thread runs an inline shell that alone guarantees completion (decision B).
- **D3** — BEAM-style **reduction-counting preemption** (`reds` budget, yield at exhaustion to the run
  queue's tail) so a CPU-bound fiber can't starve siblings.
- **D4** — Go-style per-worker local run queues + shared global overflow + random-victim work-stealing +
  periodic global check; runnable-gated park wake (a true `cv.wait` when `runnable==0`, bounded backoff +
  re-steal when `>0` — the mutex *is* the StoreLoad barrier, no Go-style fence needed).
- **D5** — **dirty/blocking pool**: a blocking off-heap-safe native (`read_file`/`write_file`, `fs.*`,
  `request`, `process`, `sleep_ms`) suspends the fiber and hands the call to a growable pool instead of
  pinning a core worker; an `inflight` fiber-state vetoes a false deadlock. A process-wide timer thread
  (later folded into the poll thread) parks sleepers on a deadline min-heap. *Path C* demotes the worker
  (one raw replacement OS thread, Go-`handoffp`-style) for a blocking `recv`/`sleep`/socket op reached
  *inside a native callback* (`native_reentry > 0`, host-stack loop frame, unsnapshotable).
- **D6a/b** — **netpoller** (`src/vm/poller.rs`, epoll/kqueue via `polling`): a would-block socket op
  becomes a cheap fiber-park. `std.net` (`Obj::Socket`/`Obj::Listener` over `Arc` cores) — non-blocking
  `connect`/`listen`/`accept`/`read`/`write`/`close`/`addr`; `connect` is true non-blocking via
  `socket2`. Drain-on-fault re-injects socket-parked fibers so a net server can share a nursery with a
  fallible sibling; one poll thread serves both socket readiness and sleeps.
- **D6c** — **per-socket read/accept/write timeout** (`--parallel`): `conn.read(n, timeout_ms)` /
  `sock.write(s, timeout_ms)` / `server.accept(timeout_ms)` return `Err("timeout")`; `0` polls once, a
  negative saturates. Reuses D6b's deadline-bounded poll, no new thread/heap/job (`poller::Parked` gains
  a `deadline`, a `fire_due_socket_timeouts` pass sets a per-fiber `poll_timed_out` marker). Checker
  gained optional trailing-arg arity. `examples/socket_timeout.chz`.

**Per-connection `spawn`** also landed — an **eager injectable nursery** (`--parallel` M:N, ≥2 cores): a
`spawn` in a *nested* `parallel:` runs concurrently with the rest of the body instead of queueing for the
join, so the canonical server shape (accept-loop `spawn`s a `handle(conn)` per connection) works. The
nested nursery is eager (`EnterNursery` builds the `MnSched` immediately + spawns one dedicated raw
drainer thread); a `spawn` injects a live fiber straight into it; a `body_open` flag holds termination
open and vetoes the deadlock predicate while the body may still inject. **v1 limits (documented):** needs
≥2 hw threads; bounded accept loops only (an unbounded `while true:` server never reaches the join —
graceful shutdown is future work); a handler talking back to the acceptor via a Channel is a cross-nursery
wakeup. `examples/echo_server_spawn.chz`.

**`Channel.close()` + closed-channel semantics + `try_send` + `for v in ch:`** landed (both engines) —
the headline consumer-side feature giving clean producer→consumer termination (was: a consumer looping
`recv` after the producer was done could only deadlock-fault):
- `for v in ch:` — blocking iteration, drains buffered + future values, ends cleanly once
  closed-and-drained (Go's `for v := range ch`).
- `ch.close()` — idempotent, no args, wakes every parked/demoted receiver.
- `send` after close → faults; `recv` on closed-and-empty → faults (drains buffered first).
- `ch.try_send(v) -> bool` — the safe partner of `send` (`false` = closed; channels are unbounded, so
  closed is `send`'s only failure mode). `try_recv` unchanged (`None` on closed).
- Comprehension-over-channel (`[v for v in ch]`) is **rejected by the checker** (it would diverge — VM
  drains, interp oracle can't).

**Pending-`spawn`-drop on early `parallel:` escape → cancel-and-report** landed (both engines): a
`parallel:` body escaping via `?`/`return`/`break`/`continue` before the join now **cancels** unstarted
tasks (the same end-state a started sibling reaches under cancellation) and emits one byte-identical
stdout report line. VM routes a `drain_escaped_nursery` through four reclaim sites (`do_return`, the
recover-catch fault path, a net-new `Op::ReclaimNursery` for break/continue, and the `do_try` recover-
scoped-`?` short-circuit, which drains the escaped body's defers to its floor *before* the report so
interp order is restored).

### Group B (B3.0–B3.6) — the OS-thread multicore epic, complete

Decomposed and documented in **[`docs/concurrency-b3.md`](docs/concurrency-b3.md)** (validated
shared-nothing architecture, decisions A–G, risk register). Summary of the landing:

- **B3.0–B3.2** — a `WireValue` airlock (`src/vm/wire.rs`) replaced `deep_clone`; `Channel`/`Shared`/
  `Executor` cores moved out of the GC heap into `Arc<…Core>` (`src/vm/core.rs`); `program` went
  `Rc<Program>` → `Arc<Program>`; `Vm::spawn_worker`/`run_task_isolated` build an isolated worker `Vm`
  with its own heap and cross args/captures/result by wire (cross-heap safety enforced via
  `ensure_crossable`). All single-thread, behavior byte-identical.
- **B3.3** — `str` crosses by value (`WireValue::Str`); the **G1 module-globals checker gate** (mutating
  a module global reachable from a `spawn` task is a type error, *"use Shared[T]"* — scope-aware,
  transitive over the free-fn call graph); worker module-graph reconstruction (read-only `home` snapshot
  + method tasks); then **real OS threads behind `--parallel`** (bounded pool, parent participates inline,
  per-core condvar `recv`, `Shared.update` lock).
- **B3.4** — cooperative **cancellation** + cross-thread `os.exit` (per-nursery `cancel` flag, first
  fault/exit trips it; `os.exit` wins over any sibling fault; cancel bypasses `recover:` but still runs
  `defer`s). Single-level only — nested-nursery cancel propagation is documented/deferred.
- **B3.5** — nursery-local **deadlock detection** under threads (barrier-confirm detector; later retired
  in favour of D2b's exact single-coordinator predicate).
- **B3.6** — `Executor` on the pool + the **A3b `submit`-capture sendability gate** (checker). Under
  `--parallel` a submitted closure crosses by value (`WireValue::Closure`); the cooperative default
  engine keeps crossing it by handle so its same-heap drain shares captures by reference (matching the
  interp oracle — a by-value snapshot would break parity for the sequential subset).

### M-C — implicit nurseries (shipped 2026-06-12)

Every function body and the module top level is an implicit nursery that joins at its `return`/end
(module top joins at program exit); a bare `spawn` is legal anywhere, dropping the explicit `parallel:`
requirement. `parallel:` is demoted to an explicit *inner* sub-nursery for earlier joins. Design:
[`docs/concurrency.md §10`](docs/concurrency.md). Concurrency is now feature-complete (no Tier-E).

- **Join-on-exit.** `return <value>`, fall-through end, and `?` early-return are all join points —
  spawned tasks run FIFO, *then* control leaves; `defer`s run after the join (tasks, then cleanup). A
  `return`/`?` that escapes an *inner* `parallel:` still cancels-and-reports that inner nursery while
  joining the function's implicit one. An uncaught body fault cancels-and-reports the implicit nursery
  (abnormal exit) — identical to an explicit `parallel:` escape.
- **Single join site + zero-overhead gate.** Compiler pre-scans a body for a bare `spawn`
  (`compiler::block_has_bare_spawn`, stops at `parallel:`/nested-fn/`spawn:`-block); if present it emits
  one opening `Op::EnterNursery` and sets `Proto::has_implicit_nursery`. The VM's `do_return` joins it
  (cancel-inner-then-join-implicit, before defers) for `return`/`?`/end. Bodies with no bare spawn emit
  byte-identical bytecode to pre-M-C — perf benches (no spawns) unchanged.
- **Implicit nursery sites.** Function bodies, the module top level, **`spawn:` blocks, and `defer:`
  blocks** each get their own implicit nursery (each runs in its own frame; a bare `spawn` inside binds
  to *that* body's nursery). Joins at the body's own `return`/end.
- **Three-engine parity.** Interp (`call`/`run_block_task`/`eval_top_level` push an implicit nursery +
  `leave_implicit_nursery` join/cancel), cooperative VM, and `--parallel` are byte-identical. Tests:
  `vm::tests::implicit_nursery_*` (3-engine, incl. `_try_preserves_error_value` +
  `_spawn_in_defer_block` review-panel regressions), `interp::tests::implicit_nursery_*`, golden
  `examples/implicit_nursery.chz`. Checker `spawn_at_function_scope_ok` / `spawn_in_plain_fn_ok` /
  `spawn_at_module_toplevel_ok` (the old `spawn_outside_parallel_rejected` flipped); dead
  `nursery_depth` checker field removed.
- **RESOLVED (2026-06-12) — uncaught-fault cancel-report parity:** an *uncaught* fault with un-run
  nursery tasks now prints the cancel-report on the VM's stdout too, matching the interp and the
  `--parallel` engine. Three coordinated fixes in `src/vm/mod.rs`: (1) `unwind_deferred` gained a
  `report_escaped: bool` param — on a genuine fault (passed `true` from the fault-unwind arm; `false`
  from the two B3.4-cancel paths) it now cancels-and-reports each discarded frame's escaped nurseries
  **before** that frame's `defer`s run, matching the interp order (`exec_parallel` /
  `leave_implicit_nursery` report as the body unwinds, then `finish_frame` runs defers); the old
  `_ => return Err(rte)` uncaught arm reported nothing. (2) `drain_escaped_nursery` now reports
  **per-nursery** (innermost-first), not one combined line — two stacked nurseries → two lines, not
  `2 pending` (also fixed a latent recover-caught combine divergence). (3) the MODULE top-level
  nursery is preserved (`nursery_len + 1` floor): an uncaught *top-level* fault stays silent on both
  engines (it joins only on clean program exit). Review-panel (SRE) caught a defer/report interleave
  divergence the first cut missed; cold pass verified the shared `unwind_deferred` interactions.
  Tests: `vm::tests::uncaught_fault_reports_implicit_nursery` / `_explicit_parallel` /
  `_each_nursery_separately` / `_reports_before_frame_defers` / `_interleaves_report_and_defer_per_frame`
  / `_uncaught_toplevel_fault_does_not_report_module_nursery`, plus `recover_caught_fault_reports_*`.
  Full suite green (1600), three-engine parity.

### Standing decisions & contracts (do not re-litigate)

> **DECISION — do NOT build interp B1/B2 (suspendable tree-walker). Deliberate non-goal.** The interpreter
> stays frozen at the sequential concurrency subset and serves as the differential-testing parity oracle
> for the non-blocking surface (its real value: catching VM / GC / compiler bugs). Suspendable execution
> would need stackful coroutines or a full CPS `eval` rewrite — large, risky, covering a slice the oracle
> does not need. **The VM is the sole concurrent engine.**

- **Parity contract (narrowed, intentional):** the engines agree on the **sequential subset** — all
  *non-blocking* `parallel:` / `spawn` / `Channel` / `Shared` / `Executor` programs (byte-identical,
  parity-tested). **Suspendable concurrency (blocking `recv`) is VM-only by design**: under `--interp` a
  blocking `recv` faults `deadlock` (pinned by an interp test vs the VM golden). This divergence is the
  stated contract, not a bug.
- **Known VM v1 limits (acceptable; not parity issues):** a blocking `recv` reached inside a native
  callback (list HOFs, `sort`, `compare`/`hash`/`str` hooks, `Shared.update`, executor drain, a `defer`red
  call) faults `deadlock` *unless* Path C demotion applies (`recv`/`sleep`/socket under `--parallel`); a
  fiber in an outer nursery cannot be woken by progress in an inner one (structured-concurrency scoping).
  Documented residuals: a narrow parked-sibling false-positive under multi-demote; the `Shared.update`
  same-box recv hazard; a saturated-pool queued-task counted live (no-false-positive choice).
- **Use `iter.map`/`iter.filter`/`iter.fold`/`iter.reduce` (chezzi source, `std/iter.chz`)** if a
  callback may block under `--parallel` — they run through VM frames so a blocking `recv` parks. The
  native `xs.map(f)` is the faster non-blocking path (and demotes via Path C if a `recv` blocks in it).

**Permanent non-goals:** interp B1/B2 (above); `yield`/generators, variadic args, Level-3 dynamic
`cdylib`/C-ABI FFI, bignum (`i64`-only — every overflow is a recoverable fault; binary work → a future
`bytes` *sequence*, no `byte`/`u8` scalar).

## Done (newest → oldest)

One bullet per milestone/epic. Full landing detail (TDD notes, review-panel findings, test-count deltas,
branch names) is in the git log.

- ✅ **D6c — per-socket read/accept/write timeout** (`--parallel`) — `read(n, timeout_ms)` /
  `write(s, timeout_ms)` / `accept(timeout_ms)` → `Err("timeout")`; reuses the deadline-bounded poll, no
  new thread/heap/job. In-callback (Path-C) timeout out of scope v1.
- ✅ **D6a/D6b — netpoller + non-blocking `std.net`** — epoll/kqueue poll thread (`src/vm/poller.rs`)
  turns a would-block socket op into a fiber-park; `Obj::Socket`/`Obj::Listener` over `Arc` cores; true
  non-blocking `connect` (`socket2`); drain-on-fault re-injects socket-parked fibers; timer folded into
  the poll thread. Echo server services 100 conns ≫ workers in one `parallel:`.
- ✅ **D5 — dirty/blocking pool** (+ owes #1–#3) — a blocking off-heap-safe native suspends the fiber and
  hands the call to a growable pool instead of pinning a core worker; process-wide timer thread for
  `sleep_ms`; `request`/`process` classified blocking; `iter.*` HOFs (chezzi source) let a `recv` in a
  callback park; **Path C** demotes the worker (one raw replacement thread) for a `recv`/`sleep`/socket op
  reached inside a native callback. Residual #2 (executor-spanning demote) WON'T FIX by design.
- ✅ **D4 (a–e) — Go-style work-stealing** — per-worker local run queues (`LocalQ`) + shared global
  overflow + random-victim steal-half + periodic global check; runnable-gated park wake (the mutex *is*
  the StoreLoad barrier — no Go fence). The conditioned single-wake (`notify_one`) is a deferred
  throughput-only refinement.
- ✅ **D3 — reduction-counting preemption** (BEAM-style) — a fiber's `reds` budget yields at exhaustion to
  the run-queue tail, so a CPU-bound fiber can't starve siblings; the yield unwinds every nested
  `run_until` level via a `paused()` helper.
- ✅ **D2a/D2b — M:N scheduler** — lightweight share-nothing fibers (own heap in a swappable `FiberCtx`)
  multiplexed over the bounded pool, **parking on `recv` instead of pinning OS threads**; exact
  single-coordinator deadlock predicate; the inline join shell alone guarantees completion (decision B).
- ✅ **D1 — lazy module snapshot** — a shared read-only `Arc<ModuleSnapshot>` faulted into each worker
  heap on first access, killing the per-task module-graph rebuild.
- ✅ **D0 — O(N²)→O(N·logN) cooperative ready-queue** — per-nursery `ready` set + parked-index buckets,
  keyed by `ChannelCore` pointer; 50k fibers: seconds → tens of ms.
- ✅ **Per-connection `spawn`** — eager injectable nursery so a nested `parallel:` `spawn` runs
  concurrently with the rest of the body (the canonical accept-loop server shape). v1: ≥2 cores, bounded
  accept loops.
- ✅ **`Channel.close()` + `try_send` + `for v in ch:`** — clean producer→consumer termination, closed-
  channel fault semantics, channel-iteration (both engines); comprehension-over-channel checker-rejected.
- ✅ **Pending-`spawn`-drop on early `parallel:` escape** — unstarted tasks cancel-and-report on
  `?`/`return`/`break`/`continue` before the join (both engines, parity-restored).
- ✅ **B3.6 — `Executor` on the pool + A3b `submit`-capture gate** — submitted closure crosses by value
  under `--parallel` (`WireValue::Closure`), by handle on the cooperative oracle (parity).
- ✅ **B3.4/B3.5 — cancellation + cross-thread `os.exit` + thread deadlock detection** — per-nursery
  `cancel` flag (first fault/exit trips it; `os.exit` wins; cancel bypasses `recover:` but runs `defer`s).
  Single-level cancel only (nested propagation deferred).
- ✅ **B3.3 (a–d) — `str`-by-value + G1 module-globals checker gate + worker module-graph reconstruction +
  real OS threads behind `--parallel`** — mutating a `spawn`-reachable module global is a checker error
  ("use Shared[T]"); bounded pool, parent participates inline.
- ✅ **B3.0–B3.2 — `WireValue` airlock + cores into `Arc<…Core>` + `Arc<Program>` + isolated worker VMs**
  — `deep_clone` → wire round-trip; `Channel`/`Shared`/`Executor` cores out of the heap; cross-heap safety
  enforced (`ensure_crossable`). All single-thread, byte-identical. See `docs/concurrency-b3.md`.
- ✅ **Concurrency A1 — `Channel.try_recv() -> T?`** — non-blocking poll (both engines), un-deferred once
  B1/B2 landed.
- ✅ **Concurrency C5 / Group B — B1 + B2 cooperative fibers + blocking `recv`** (VM) — suspendable
  execution: a `recv` on an empty channel parks the fiber and the nursery-local scheduler runs a sibling.
- ✅ **Concurrency C5 — `Executor` escape hatch** + **A2 program-exit auto-drain** + **A3a** (pinned) — the
  sequential-subset `Executor()` / `submit` / `shutdown[_now]`, drained at clean exit (both engines).
- ✅ **Concurrency C4 — VM parity for `spawn`/`parallel:`/`Channel`/`Shared`** — ported C1–C3 onto the
  default bytecode engine (heap objs, ops, VM `deep_clone`, sequential nursery executor).
- ✅ **Concurrency C3 — `Shared[T]`** (interp) — cross-task mutable box (`get`/`set`/`update`); handle
  sendable, `Ref[T]` forced non-sendable.
- ✅ **Concurrency C2 — `Channel[T]` + sendability** (interp) — buffered FIFO mailbox; a `sendable(Ty)`
  predicate gates element types, `spawn` args, and capture reassignment.
- ✅ **Concurrency C1 — `spawn` / `parallel:` nursery** (interp, sequential executor) — structured
  concurrency; `spawn f(x)` and `spawn:` block run to completion FIFO at the dedent.
- ✅ **Integer overflow policy** — every `i64` overflow is a recoverable fault (never wrap/crash).
- ✅ **Gaps pass II** — `Ref[T]` mutable box (`std/ref.chz`); `sort_by_key`; call fn-typed field
  `self.f(x)`; relaxed non-const defaults; runtime stack traces (both engines).
- ✅ **Scripting-ergonomics gap pass** — hex/bin/oct literals; list `.concat`/`.extend` + map
  `.merge`/`.update`; tuple-destructuring `for` + `enumerate`/`zip`; `?.` + `??`; tuple destructuring +
  match-on-tuple + guards.
- ✅ **Fix — loop variable is immutable** — checker rejects assigning a `for`-loop var (was a VM/interp
  divergence); inner `:=` shadow stays mutable.
- ✅ **M18 — `defer` → block/lexical scope** — runs when its enclosing block exits on every path, LIFO,
  inner-block-first. Supersedes M17.
- ✅ **M17 — `defer` (Go-style, frame-scoped)** — runs at frame exit, LIFO; receiver+args evaluated at the
  `defer` statement.
- ✅ **M16 — comprehensions + `std.os.exit(code)`** — `[e for x in it if g]` (+ set/map forms),
  first-class AST node; hard uncatchable cooperative exit.
- ✅ **M15 — slicing + `Index`/`IndexSet`/`Slice` protocols** — `xs[1..3]` half-open/clamped; list/map/str
  intrinsic, user structs structural.
- ✅ **M14 — method-level type params** · user-defined parameterized protocols · default + named args on
  methods (desugar-pass).
- ✅ **Default + named arguments** — free fns + struct ctors; scope-aware desugar pass, both engines
  consume a normalized AST.
- ✅ **Tech-debt sweep** — reject dup generic param `[T, T]`; nested `set` equality parity; explicit
  call-site type args `name[T,…](…)`.
- ✅ **M11 — panic recovery + Go-style errors** — 2-param `Result[T, E]` (`T!`/`T!E`), `Error` protocol,
  `recover:` boundary catching any transitive runtime fault.
- ✅ **M10 — type-system depth** — `Stringable`/`Hashable`, per-operator `Add`/`Sub`/`Mul` protocols,
  multi-bound `T: A + B`, transparent aliases, generic enums; `map`/`set` reworked into insertion-ordered
  hash tables.
- ✅ **M9 — Tier-2 stdlib** — `std.regex` (`regex` crate) + `std.request` (`ureq`+rustls, blocking).
- ✅ **M8 — Tier-1 stdlib** — iterable strings + `chars()`; `std.json` (pure-Chezzi + `decode[T]`); native
  `std.process`/`std.fs`/`std.time`; `set` type.
- ✅ **M7 — generics + structural protocols** — type-erased generic fns/structs, Go-style `protocol`s,
  `Comparable`; `std.cmp`; `list.sort()` widened.
- ✅ **Round 2 gaps #10–#15** — `sort_by`, `ord`/`chr`, int+float math, map `for`, nested/tuple match,
  bitwise ops; iterator protocol (`next()`), `Iterator[T]` bound + lazy adapters, match guards +
  half-open range patterns.
- ✅ **Tuples + multiple return + destructuring (gap #8)** — `(e1, e2, …)`, tuple types, `a, b := f()`,
  `.0`/`.1`; immutable, fixed-arity, GC-traced.
- ✅ **M6a/b/c** — core-type str/list methods; pipe `|>` (parse-time desugar); stdlib via the Level-2
  native FFI seam (`std.math`/`std.io`/`std.os` native, `std.str` pure Chezzi).
- ✅ **`map[K, V]` dictionary (gap #5)** — literals, keyed read/insert/update, six methods, GC-traced.
- ✅ **Index & field assignment** — `xs[i] = v`, `p.x = v`, `+=`/`-=` in place (both engines).
- ✅ **M5a/b/c** — bytecode compiler + stack VM; hand-built mark-sweep GC; cross-engine parity + perf;
  CLI default flip to the VM (`--interp` for the tree-walker). `read_file` capped at 64 MiB.
- ✅ **M4.5 — modules / imports + resolver** — multi-file, `chezzi.toml` root, run-once dep order,
  cross-module home-globals, cycle detection; program-global type names.
- ✅ **M4 — type checker (local inference)** — bidirectional, no unification; return-type inference,
  `T?`/`T!` sugar, expression-valued `match`/`if`, Go-style error accumulation.
- ✅ **M3 — tree-walk interpreter** — full expr/stmt set, `?` operator, interpolation, 256 MB-stack thread
  + `MAX_CALL_DEPTH` guard.
- ✅ **M2.5 — canonical grammar + conformance** — `docs/grammar.bnf` executed via the `bnf` crate,
  differential-tested vs the parser. `cargo test conformance`.
- ✅ **M2 — parser → AST** — recursive descent + Pratt; spans; depth-capped.
- ✅ **M1 — lexer** — full `examples/hello.chz` incl. Indent/Dedent; string escapes, numeric underscores.
  Open follow-ups: scientific notation `1e3`, single-quote strings, unicode `\u{…}` escapes.

## Roadmap (later)

- VM/GC optimizations beyond M19 — NaN-boxing (own milestone), register VM, generational/incremental GC,
  Cranelift AOT/JIT. Written up in [`docs/future.md`](docs/future.md).
- ~~**M-C — implicit nurseries**~~ — **shipped 2026-06-12** (see Concurrency above).

### Ideas — record-only (not scheduled)

- **Native FFI / Rust-library bindings** — let Chezzi call into Rust libs; design sketch in `docs/spec.md`
  → *Standard library* → "Future idea — native FFI". Default build stays zero third-party crates; dynamic
  `cdylib` plugins deferred. Do not start without an explicit decision.

---

## Known friction / open (document-only)

Surfaced by coverage passes; no `src/` changes pending, recorded for when they bite:

- **Collection literals must be single-line** — a newline inside `[`/`{` ends the expression.
- **`match` limits** — no multiple `Some(...)` arms, no nested nullary-variant patterns (nest a second
  `match`).
- **Float division by zero is a runtime fault**, not an IEEE `Inf`/`NaN`.
- **`std.os.getcwd`** not yet injectable via `HostConfig` (parity holds); **`read_file`** capped at 64 MiB.

## Notes

- Recursive structs "just work" via the checker's two-pass name collection — trees and linked lists need
  only `Node?` child fields + a `match` per step, no special support.
