#![cfg_attr(test, allow(clippy::wildcard_enum_match_arm))]
//! Chezzi as a library — the compiler **front-end** and the engine, exposed as the crate of record.
//!
//! This is the real crate root: both binaries are thin shims that link this library. `src/main.rs`
//! (the `chezzi` CLI) and `src/bin/chezzi-lsp.rs` (the LSP server) declare no front-end modules of
//! their own — they `use chezzi::{…}`. The front-end therefore compiles **once**, and its module
//! unit tests + the golden VM tests + the grammar `conformance` suite run **once**,
//! here in the lib's test target (a plain `cargo test` no longer double-compiles/double-runs them).
//!
//! NOTE for future CLI work: `src/main.rs` is the *bin* crate, so across the crate boundary it can
//! only see `pub` items of this lib (not `pub(crate)`). If a new CLI subcommand references a lib item,
//! that item must be `pub` here — mirror the existing `pub mod` front-end surface.

// The front-end modules are `pub` so every item the binaries reach across the crate boundary is
// visible, and so the modules' own dead-code analysis stays whole-crate. `editor` is the tooling layer
// consumed by `chezzi-lsp`; the rest are the compiler/VM pipeline driven by the `chezzi` CLI.
/// `println!` / `eprintln!` / `print!` for the CLI's own messages (diagnostics, `ok: no type errors`,
/// usage). A closed pipe (`chezzi check f.chz 2>&1 | head -1`) drops the write instead of panicking
/// (rc=101); the command keeps its own exit code, as `go vet` does. A program's own output does not
/// come here: it goes through the VM's `emit_out` / `stream_halt` path.
